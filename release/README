This README describes the release zip file format that this testing framework expects.

All releases should be zipped up into a single zip file. The zip file should have the name
"anwork-X.zip" where X is the version of the anwork release (e.g., anwork-15.zip).

When the zip file is expanded, the directory structure should look as follows.
anwork-X/  # X should be the version of the anwork release (e.g., anwork-15)
  bin/
    anwork # this is the anwork executable that will be called by the test framework
  doc/
    ...    # any documentation files should live here
  ...      # there can be any number of other directories and files
